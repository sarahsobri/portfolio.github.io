# Project 1 : Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Under-Extreme-Imbalanced-Data (Project Overview)

##### Due to the small number of cases of one class, the machine learning model struggles to generalise the behaviour of the minority class, resulting in poor predicted accuracy (Japkowicz & Stephen, 1998). This has hampered the ability of numerous models to function to their full capacity in tackling this long-standing issue. As a result, multiple resampling approaches will be used in this project, including:

1. Random under-sampling
2. Synthetic Modified Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) 
3. Modified Synthetic Modified Oversampling Technique (MSMOTE) 

##### The outcome of these machine learning models have been assessed by their:
1. Sensitivity 
2. Specificity
3. Accuracy
4. Precision
5. Recall
6. F1-Score

##### The classification techniques which were used to classify the resampled datasets were:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. XGBoost

##### Upon completeing the analysis, we have found that the best model that outperforms the rest is the random forest with SMOTE with precision of 88% and recall of approximately 85%. Morever, the model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 100%.
